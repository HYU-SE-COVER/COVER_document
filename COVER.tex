\begin{abstract}
In recent times, the global smart home market has seen remarkable expansion, projected to cross \$164 billion by 2028. Driven by the desire for convenience, security, and energy savings, we're witnessing sophisticated device integrations in our homes. However, this growth isn't without its challenges. The array of smart home devices from different brands has fragmented the user experience, leading to a maze of applications for device control. Many third-party apps, despite their intentions, often don't mesh seamlessly with central control devices like smartphones, a challenge evident in platforms such as Apple Home and Google Home App . Additionally, a significant number of devices still lack IoT integration, which challenges expanding smart home market.[1]\\
Addressing these challenges, we introduce the LG Cover, an innovative solution designed to bridge gaps in the smart home ecosystem. We suggest specialized integration for all LG devices, resurrecting legacy devices through the Matter protocol, and ensuring consistent user experience across various brands. This system supports the integration of both Matter and ThinQ devices, and also supports older devices based on IR technology, revitalizing its utility within modern smart home setups.\\
To facilitate seamless integration, the LG Cover adopt a structured setup process involving the registration of the hub to the ThinQ app and the Matter API device. ThinQ supporting or IR supporting devices are connected to LG Cover with proprietary protocols, and LG Cover mediates the connected devices to Matter enabled controllers. Users are enabled to communicate with non-Matter-supporting devices through LG Cover using Matter API. With LG Cover's comprehensive approach, users can experience the convenience of a unified smart home ecosystem, irrespective of the device's age or brand.

\section{\large{Introduction}}
\subsection{\large{Motivation}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Growth of Smart Home Systems\\
The smart home market has experienced remarkable growth over the last few years. According to Statista, the global smart home market is projected to surpass \$141 billion by 2023, up from \$76.6 billion in 2018.[2] This exponential growth is driven by consumers' increasing desire for convenience, security, and energy efficiency. As homes integrate more devices, the need for a cohesive control system becomes critical.\\
\item The Challenge of Diverse Devices from Different Companies \\
As smart home devices proliferate, a significant challenge arises due to the sheer variety of brands and products available. Different companies offer their distinct range of smart devices, each with its dedicated application for control. This leads to an overflow of applications on users' smartphones or tablets, complicating what should be a simplified process.[3][4] The fragmentation of control interfaces creates inefficiency and reduces the user-friendly nature of the smart home system. There's a clear need for a centralized platform, like Matter, that can consolidate control, ensuring that users can manage their entire smart home ecosystem without juggling multiple applications. \\
Additionally, there is a potential risk of user's personal information being exposed when remotely controlling products of diverse companies through IoT. Currently, when a user issues a command to turn on the lights from a mobile phone, it often goes through a cloud-based connection between the phone and the hub, and then the operation is executed via an API.[5] With Matter, all operations can be performed locally without passing through external servers, ensuring that personal information is not exposed.\\
\item Bridging the IoT Gap with LG Cover\\
While many modern devices are equipped with IoT capabilities, a substantial portion remains without this integration. The disparity between IoT-enabled devices and those lacking this feature can result in gaps within the smart home ecosystem. Matter, a unifying protocol for smart home devices, can introduce IoT capabilities to previously incompatible devices. LG Cover, supporting Matter, acts as a bridge, allowing even non-IoT devices to join the integrated smart home network. This inclusivity ensures that no device is left out, offering users a comprehensive smart home experience.\\

C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, and provides features such as overloading, templates, and exceptions, which are not available in C. The core components of ESP-IDF and the APIs provided for interacting with the ESP32 hardware are written in C. This allows for efficient interaction with the hardware and is suitable for the resource-constrained environments typically associated with embedded systems. The framework provides support for C++ exceptions and other features, allowing developers to leverage the object-oriented aspects of C++ in their ESP32 projects.\\
